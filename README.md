# Official Africa's Talking C# API wrapper 

The Africa's Talking C# API wrapper provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API from applications written in C#. With support for .NET45, .NET46 and .NET Standard 2.0. 

## Documentation 
Take a look at the [API docs here](http://docs.africastalking.com/) for more information. 

## Installation Options
1. #### Using Visual Studio IDE

+ On a new project, Navigate to the ***Solution Explorer*** tab within Visual Studio. 
+ Right-click on the ***References*** node and click on the *Manage Nuget Packages* from the resulting context menu. 
+ On the Nuget Package Manager window navigate to the ***Browse*** Tab. 
+ Key in **AfricasTalking.NET** and select version _1.1.411_ or higher. 
+ Click on the ***Install*** button and accept the licences to proceed. 

> For .NET Standard 2.0 projects yellow triangles may appear on your solution items,note that these are warnings due to deprecated support for some packages used by the wrapper.These will be reviewed in future releases,for now they will not affect the functionality of your project and can be safely ignored.Should there be a case where this package breaks your project kindly report the package via Nuget.

2. #### Using .NET CLI 

+ From the _command prompt/powershell window_ opened in your project directory, key in the following and press *Enter*. 
```powershell 
 dotnet add package AfricasTalking.NET --version 1.1.411
```
> Ensure you have the latest version of the package. Visit [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AfricasTalking.NET/) for more info on the latest release of this package. 

3. #### Using Nuget Package Manger Console 

+ On your Nuget package manager console,key in the following and press *Enter* 
```powershell 
Install-Package AfricasTalking.NET -Version 1.1.41 
```
> Ensure you have the latest version of the package. Visit [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AfricasTalking.NET/) for more info on the latest release of this package

## Usage 

+ To use this package ensure you add the following `using` statement to your project file: 
```csharp 
 using AfricasTalkingCS;
```

The package needs to be configured with your Africa's Talking username and API key (which you can get from the dashboard). 

```csharp  

var username = "YourUSERNAME";
var apiKey = "yourAPIKEY";
var env = "sandbox"; //Use this only if you need to use the sandbox environment,otherwise ignore. 

```
> Your default environment is **production**,hence you can use our gateway class as shown below

```csharp  

 var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apiKey);
  
```
> Otherwise, for sandbox;see below 

```csharp 
 
 var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apiKey, env); 
 
```
## Important: 
 If you register a callback URL with the API, always remember to acknowledge the receipt of any data it sends by responding with an HTTP `200`;  [Here's a sample application you can use to test a call-back url](https://github.com/TheBeachMaster/ATSamples/tree/master/paymentcallback.node) 
> For example in an ASP.NET Core or ASP.NET MVC Project

```csharp 
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult SomeCoolMethod(awesome,params)
{
   // Your awesome logic

   //If not using MVC5
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(200);

   //If using MVC5
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.OK);  // OK = 200
} 
```

### SMS 
```csharp 
            try
            {
                var sms = gateway.SendMessage(recepients, msg);
                foreach (var res in sms["SMSMessageData"]["Recipients"])
                {
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["number"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["status"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["messageId"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["cost"] + ": ");
                }
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException exception)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(exception);
            }
```

#### [Sending SMS](http://docs.africastalking.com/sms/sending)

        -   `enque` : This parameter is used for Bulk SMS clients that would like deliver as many messages to the API before waiting for an Ack from the Telcos. If enabled, the API will store the messages in its databases and send them out asynchronously after responding to the request

> [Read more](http://docs.africastalking.com/sms/callback)

- `FetchMessages(lastReceivedId)` : Manually retrieve your messages.

    - `lastReceivedId` : This is the id of the message that you last processed. If this is your first call, pass in 0. `REQUIRED`

     > If you have subscription products on your premium SMS short codes, you will need to configure a callback URL that we will invoke to notify you when users subscribe or unsubscribe from your products (currently supported on Safaricom).Visit [this link](http://docs.africastalking.com/subscriptions/callback) to learn more on how to setup a subscription callback  

> Example    - Creating Premium SMS subscription

```c#
            var username = "sandbox";
            var apikey = "KEY";
            var env = "sandbox";

            var shortCode = "NNNNN";
            var keyword = "keyword";
            var phoneNum = "+254XXXXXXXXX";
            var token = "Token";
            try

                var response = gateway.CreateSubscription(phoneNum, shortCode, keyword, token);
                Console.WriteLine(response);
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("We hit a snag: " + e.StackTrace + ". " + e.Message);
                throw;
