## Usage 

+ To use this package ensure you add the following `using` statement to your project file: 
```csharp 
 using AfricasTalkingCS;
```

The package needs to be configured with your Africa's Talking username and API key (which you can get from the dashboard). 

```csharp  

 const string username = "sandbox"; // substitute with your username if mot using sandbox
 const string apikey = "mySandboxKey"; // substitute with your production API key if not using sandbox

```


```csharp  

 var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apiKey);
  
```
> Important:

 If you register a callback URL with the API, always remember to acknowledge the receipt of any data it sends by responding with an HTTP `200`;  [Here's a sample application you can use to test a call-back url](https://github.com/TheBeachMaster/ATSamples/tree/master/paymentcallback.node) 
> For example in an ASP.NET Core or ASP.NET MVC Project

```csharp 
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult SomeCoolMethod(awesome, params)
{
   // Your awesome logic

   //If not using MVC5
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(200);

   //If using MVC5
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.OK);  // OK = 200
} 
```

### SMS 
```csharp 
            try
            {
                var sms = gateway.SendMessage(recepients, msg);
                foreach (var res in sms["SMSMessageData"]["Recipients"])
                {
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["number"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["status"] + ": ");

#### [Banking - Transfer](http://docs.africastalking.com/bank/transfer)


- `BankTransfer(productName,recipients)` :  Our API allows you to initiate multiple transactions in one request, all of which will be queued in our gateways for processing.Once the payment provider confirms or rejects the payment request, our APIs will generate a payment notification and send it to the callback URL configured in your account.  [More info](http://docs.africastalking.com/bank/transfer) 

    - `productName` :  This value identifies the Africa's Talking Payment Product that should be used to initiate this transaction. `REQUIRED`   
    - `recipients` :  This contains a list of Recipient elements, each of which corresponds to a B2C Transaction request. The format for                           each of these recipients is described in the table below. `REQUIRED`.
        - `bankAccount` : This is a complex type whose structure is described below. It contains the details of the bank account to be charged in this transaction.  
            - `accountName` :  The name of the bank account. `Optional`
            - `accountNumber` : The account number. `REQUIRED` 
            - `bankCode` :  A 6-Digit Integer Code for the bank that we allocate. `REQURED`. See this [link](http://docs.africastalking.com/bank/transfer) for more details
            - `dateOfBirth` : Date of birth of the account owner. `Optional`/`Required` - for Zenith Bank NG. 

        - `currencyCode` : This is the 3-digit ISO format currency code for the value of this transaction (e.g NGN, USD, KES etc). 
        - `amount` : This is the amount (in the provided currency) that the mobile subscriber is expected to confirm. 
        - `narration` : A short description of the transaction that can be displayed on the client's statement. 
        - `metadata` : This value contains a map of any metadata that you would like us to associate with this request. You can use this field to send data that will map notifications to checkout requests, since we will include it when we send notifications once the checkout is complete.

### [USSD Push](http://docs.africastalking.com/ussd)
> A few things to note about USSD: 

+ USSD is session driven. Every request we send you will contain a sessionId, and this will be maintained until that session is completed
+ **USSD push currently works in Nigeria only**

### Building a USSD Application 

1. Start by creating a new Web ASP.NET project from any Visual Studio IDE instance  ![Create Application](ScreenShots/ussdapp/CreateApplication.PNG)

2. Select an **Empty**  ASP.NET template and **Ensure you have selected WebAPI** as part of project options ![Select Template](ScreenShots/ussdapp/SelectTemplate.PNG)

3. On your newly created application, navigate to **Solution Explorer** and *right-click* on the *Controllers* folder to add/create a new Controller ![Create Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/CreateController.PNG)

4. From the resulting context menu, select **Add>Controller** ![Click to Add Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/ClicktoAddController.png)

5. Go ahead and select the **Web API 2 Controller -Empty** Controller template from the Controller scaffold menu ![Select Web API 2 Empty Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/SelectWebAPI2EmptyController.PNG) 

6. Rename your Controller ![Name Your Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/NameYourController.PNG)

7. Now, in our `USSDServiceController` , go ahead and paste the following code 

   ```c#
   using System;
   using System.Net;
   using System.Net.Http;
   using System.Text;
   using System.Web.Http;

   namespace USSDDemo.Controllers
   {
       [RoutePrefix("application/services")] // Your Application will be served as http(s)://<host>:port/application/services/...
       public class USSDServiceController : ApiController
       {
           [Route("ussdservice")]  // http(s)://<host>:port/application/services/ussdservice
           [HttpPost,ActionName("ussdservice")]

           public HttpResponseMessage httpResponseMessage([FromBody] UssdResponse ussdResponse)
           {
               HttpResponseMessage responseMessage;
               string response;

               if (ussdResponse.text == null)
               {
                   ussdResponse.text = "";
               }

               if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = "CON USSD Demo in Action\n";
                   response += "1. Do something\n";
                   response += "2. Do some other thing\n";
                   response += "3. Get my Number\n";
               }
               else if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("1",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = "END I am doing something \n";
               }else if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("2",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = "END Some other thing has been done \n";
               }else if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("3",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = $"END Here is your phone number : {ussdResponse.phoneNumber} \n";
               }
               else
               {
                   response = "END Invalid option \n";
               }

               responseMessage = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created,response);

               responseMessage.Content = new StringContent(response, Encoding.UTF8, "text/plain");

               return responseMessage;
           }
       }
   }

   ```

   This code basically gives you 3 menus :, you can create more complex logic as you wish, also , as a hack, for deeper level menus use the `*` symbol to separate between levels and sub-levels (menus and submenus). Eg `Level1>Sublevel1>Sub-sublevel1` can be represented as `1*1*1` e.t.c.

   We also have a class `UssdResponse`  as part of our controllers that makes getter and setter for whatever payload we receive from the server. It should look as so:  

   ```c#
   namespace USSDDemo.Controllers
   {
